*/ ConfigMaps
A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.

  # You set volumes at the Pod level, then mount them into containers inside that Pod
  - name: config
    configMap:
      # Provide the name of the ConfigMap you want to mount.
      name: game-demo
      # An array of keys from the ConfigMap to create as files
      items:

# This is an example of a Pod that mounts a ConfigMap in a volume:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: foo
      mountPath: "/etc/foo"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    configMap:
      name: myconfigmap

# Using Configmaps as environment variables 
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myconfigmap
data:
  username: k8s-admin
  access_level: "1"

# kubectl apply -f myconfigmap.yaml

# The following Pod consumes the content of the ConfigMap as environment variables:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: env-configmap
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "printenv"]
      image: busybox:latest
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: myconfigmap

# kubectl logs pod/ env-configmap
The output is similar to this:
...
username: "k8s-admin"
access_level: "1"
...

# immutable field to true. For example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  ...
data:
  ...
immutable: true
